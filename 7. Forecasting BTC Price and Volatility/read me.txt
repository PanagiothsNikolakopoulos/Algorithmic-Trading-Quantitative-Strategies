FORECASTING BTC PRICE AND VOLATILITY WITH LSTM & GARCH

OVERVIEW
This project analyzes Bitcoin (BTC-USD) time-series data to forecast both price and volatility. It compares a classic econometric model (GARCH) against a modern deep learning model (LSTM) to demonstrate a full-stack approach to quantitative analysis.

OBJECTIVE
1. Model and forecast the volatility (risk) of Bitcoin's daily returns using a GARCH model.
2. Forecast the next-day closing price of Bitcoin using an LSTM neural network.
3. Compare the strengths and use cases of each approach.

DATA SOURCE
Daily historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, acquired via the yfinance library.

METHODOLOGY & MODELS

Part A: GARCH for Volatility Forecasting
We analyzed log returns and identified volatility clustering. A GARCH(1,1) model was fitted, and its parameters were found to be highly statistically significant. The model successfully captured the changing risk regimes of the market.

Part B: LSTM for Price Forecasting
Closing prices were scaled and transformed into sequences (60 days of history to predict the next day). A stacked LSTM network was built and trained. The model showed a good fit with no significant overfitting.

KEY FINDINGS

GARCH(1,1)
- Task: Volatility Forecasting
- Result: Successfully captured volatility clustering and provided statistically significant risk estimates.
- Use Case: Risk Management, Options Pricing, Hedging.

LSTM Network
- Task: Price Forecasting
- Result: Effectively predicted the long-term price trend with a Test RMSE of ~$1171.
- Use Case: Trend Following Strategies, Directional Analysis.
