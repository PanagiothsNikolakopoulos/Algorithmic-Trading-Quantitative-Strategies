# Options Pricing and Risk Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains a comprehensive Python-based toolkit for the pricing and risk analysis of European-style options. It implements two fundamental pricing methodologies—the analytical Black-Scholes model and a computational Monte Carlo simulation—and provides a deep dive into the sensitivity analysis of options through the "Greeks."

This project serves as a foundational demonstration of key concepts in quantitative finance, computational methods, and risk management.

## Key Features

- **Dual Pricing Models**:
  - **Black-Scholes Model**: Implementation of the industry-standard closed-form solution for pricing European options.
  - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A stochastic approach that simulates thousands of potential price paths to determine the option's value, validating the Black-Scholes results.
- **Comprehensive Risk Analysis (The Greeks)**:
  - Calculation of **Delta**, **Gamma**, **Vega**, and **Theta** to quantify the option's sensitivity to underlying price, volatility, and time.
- **Dynamic Behavior Visualization**:
  - A 2x2 dashboard of plots that visually demonstrates how the option's price and its Greeks change dynamically as the underlying stock price fluctuates.

## Core Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- **Financial Engineering**:
  - Black-Scholes-Merton formula
  - Geometric Brownian Motion for asset path simulation
  - Risk-Neutral Pricing
  - Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic (Time) Value
  - Option Greeks (Δ, Γ, ν, Θ) for hedging and risk management
- **Computational Finance**:
  - Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing
- **Python for Data Science**:
  - **NumPy**: For efficient, vectorized numerical computations.
  - **SciPy**: For statistical functions, specifically the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating high-quality, insightful data visualizations.

## Visual Analysis of Option Dynamics

The final output of the analysis is a powerful visualization that captures the complex, non-linear behavior of options.


These plots clearly illustrate:
1.  The non-linear payoff profile of calls and puts.
2.  The "S-curve" of Delta, which represents the option's changing exposure to the underlying asset.
3.  The bell-shaped curves of Gamma and Vega, which peak at-the-money, indicating the point of maximum price instability and sensitivity to volatility.
